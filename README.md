## Rightee - Personal Writing Assistant

Rightee is a writing assistant designed to enhance users' writing by offering valuable suggestions rather than completely rewriting the content through AI. Unlike AI-generated rewrites that often use overly fancy terms and can sound inauthentic, Rightee focuses on maintaining the writerâ€™s voice. I developed Rightee as my personal writing tool that focus on practical guidance and a built-in word bank for easy access to alternative expressions.

In the top left corner, users can select parameters to define the tone of the article. For example, when writing an academic paper, a formal tone may be chosen. For an email, a casual tone could be preferred. For storytelling, options such as 'engaging' or 'narrative' can be selected. 

Users can instruct the AI to only correct grammar mistakes without altering their word choices. However, in the AI-generated version, additional suggestions for improved phrasing will be offered if the AI identifies a better option for a particular sentence. These suggestions will be underlined and highlighted when the user hovers over them.

Users can click on the highlighted sentences to view more details, where an explanation and a suggestion for improvement will be provided.

A word bank is available to provide suggestions for synonyms or antonyms. It also supports finding a matching word for a given description or providing the English equivalent of a word in foreign languages.
